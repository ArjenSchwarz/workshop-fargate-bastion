# Workshop for building a Fargate Bastion

This repo contains the code and step-by-step instructions for building a Fargate, serverless, bastion as defined in the [fargate-bastion repository](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/fargate-bastion).

In each step branch, you will find a file with instructions, named step-1.md, step-2.md, etc. This explains what the expected outcome of that step is. Example results of the step can be found in the next step. So, the code needed to recreate step-1 can be found in step-2. All the way, until the final-code branch which contains the end result.

If you find issues with anything in this repository, whether something is just wrong or the instructions are unclear, feel free to create Issues or Pull Requests so it can be improved.
